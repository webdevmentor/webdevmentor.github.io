# Webdevmentor Website

That's my website. The place where I inform about what I can do for developers and how to reach me for personal support.

## Environments

- **prod**: https://www.webdevmentor.info
- **stage**: tba
- **dev**: http://localhost:1313/

## Run locally

To run the website locally, ensure you have Hugo installed and run the following command in the project root:

```bash
hugo server
```

If you want to include content marked as drafts, use:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313/`.
